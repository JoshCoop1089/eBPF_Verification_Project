Josh: concrete evaluation -- no need to maintain bounds. Sammy: symbolic evaluation -- maintain bounds. The final FOL will check whether the symbolic and concrete evaluation match each other. If they dont, either our formalization is wrong, or the verifier's symbolic eval is buggy.

concrete eval: (state: reg, latest version, value)

symbolic eval: (state: reg, bounds on the register, type, ...)
