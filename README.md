# eBPF_Verification_Project
Work relating to Summer 2020 NSF Research \
Supervising Professors: Santosh Nagarakatte, Srinivas Narayana Ganapathy \
Undergrad Students: Josh Cooper, Sammy Berger \
Project Timeline: 6/1/2020 - 9/1/2020 \
\
Mission Statement: Students will explore static analysis and verification for programs written in the extended Bekeley Packet Filter (EBPF) language. They will also analyze and study the Linux kernel verifier for EBPF programs.\
\
Final Code from Summer REU:
