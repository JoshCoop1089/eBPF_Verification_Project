In case you've never installed Python or a module before,
this should help you get everything you need.

1. Download and install python from python.org, speficially at https://www.python.org/downloads/
 - current latest version is 3.8.3

2. More recent versions of Python (I think 3.5 and later?) come installed with pip,
   an installer for python modules. If you're using an old version, install pip.

3. Make sure your PATH is set up correctly.
 - If on Windows, click the windows button and search for "Edit the System Environment"
 - This should bring you to the 'System Properties' screen, under the 'Advanced' tab.
 - Press 'n' or look for the Environment Variables button.
 - You should see two options for user variables and System variables.
 - Under user variables, look for the PATH option.
 - Double click on it and you should get a list of adresses.
 - One should be "install_directory\Python###". This lets you run Python from command line.
 - Another should be "install_directory\Python###\Scripts". This lets you run pip.

4. To check if everything's set up correctly, try using "python --version" and "pip --version"
   in the command line.

5. If everything's set up, you can now install the Z3 module. You can type "pip install z3-solver"
   in the command line, or go to the site https://pypi.org/project/z3-solver/#files and figure
   it out from there.

Now you should be ready to use the Z3 sovler in your python code!
