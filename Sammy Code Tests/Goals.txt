6/11:
Given some eBPF programs
 - Generate typing constraints
 - Come up with a unification algorithm for the types of each of the registers
   - All variables are pointers or integers

 https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages, Week 5

6/15:
Range analysis:
 - Read paper on range analysis of Mozilla Firefox

 https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dstefan/pubs/brown:2020:vera.pdf

6/18:
 - Make a small subset of BPF instructions to analyze (5-10)
 - Model the interpreter's function with first order logic
 - Take C code used for the instruction
 - Model the verifier with first order logic

 https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/bpf/core.c (#L1359)

 from last week: https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/bpf/bpf_sock.c

6/22:
 - Focus on just maybe BPF_ADD and BPF_MOV.
 - If you can translate to Z3, that's great
 - Want to check if there are any concrete values which are valid inputs but don't produce a valid output

 Consider installing better tools (cscope, ...)

6/25:
 - Translate code into Z3
 - For helper functions, assume hard things are true
 - For now, work only on range analysis. Ignore pointer out of bounds checks.

6/29:
 - Theory of Arrays for Z3
 - Calculus of computation by Aaron Bradley, chapter on Program Verification

7/2:
 - Re-read Chapter 5 and 6, mini-lecture during 6/29 meeting should assist in understanding
 - Generate a precondition for check_alu_op (for BPF_MOV)
